# ALL ISSUES 
1) If compiling with g++ there will be an error with declaration of struct input and instanciation of input input = {} inside yocto_gui. Solutions:
* Change every reference of variable input like that var_input = {} inside yocto_gui.cpp
* compile with CLang (not tested)

2) Missing libraries like Embree of intel and OpenGL. Solutions:
* Install Embree Linux. Look at this page https://github.com/embree/embree
* Install OpenGL, followed this tutoria https://medium.com/@theorose49/install-opengl-at-ubuntu-18-04-lts-31f368d0b14e
* Modify a CMake in Yocto /out/libs/yocto add the following lines 
if(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)
  target_link_libraries(yocto /usr/lib64/libembree3.so)
  find_package(Threads REQUIRED)
  # target_link_libraries(yocto Threads::Threads)
endif(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)
and a path of the linker from the file .profile on home (not tested yet)
3) Unable to load scherma scene.schema.json ENOENT: no such file or directory. Solutions:






# Yocto/Raytrace: Tiny Raytracer

In this homework, you will learn the basic of image synthesis by 
implementing a simple naive path tracer. In particular, you will
learn how to 

- setup camera and image synthesis loops,
- usa ray-intersection queries,
- write simple shaders,
- write a naive path tracer with simple sampling.

## Framework

The code uses the library [Yocto/GL](https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl),
that is included in this project in the directory `yocto`. 
We suggest to consult the documentation for the library that you can find 
at the beginning of the header files. Also, since the library is getting improved
during the duration of the course, se suggest that you star it and watch it 
on Github, so that you can notified as improvements are made. 
In particular, we will use

- **yocto_math.h**: collection of math functions
- **yocto_image.{h,cpp}**: image data structure and image loading and saving 
- **yocto_commonio.h**: helpers for writing command line apps
- **yocto_gui.{h,cpp}**: helpers for writing simple GUIs

In order to compile the code, you have to install 
[Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
on OsX, [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/vs/) on Windows,
or a modern version of gcc or clang on Linux, 
together with the tools [cmake](www.cmake.org) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org).
The script `scripts/build.sh` will perform a simple build on OsX.
As discussed in class, we prefer to use 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), with
[C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and
[CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) 
extensions, that we have configured to use for this course.

You will write your code in the file `yocto_raytrace.cpp` for functions that 
are declared in `yocto_raytrace.h`. Your renderer is callsed by `yscenetrace.cpp` 
for a command-line interface and `ysceneitraces.cpp` that show a simple 
user interface.

This repository also contains tests that are executed from the command line
as shown in `run.sh`. The rendered images are saved in the `out/` directory. 
The results should match the ones in the directory `check/`.

## Functionality

In this homework you will implement the following features:

- **Main Rendering Loop** in function `trace_samples()`:
    - implement the main rendering loop considering only 1 sample (the loop over
      samples in done in the apps)
    - from the slides this is like the progressive rendering loop but only one 
      sample
    - update the accumulation buffer, number of samples and final image for each 
      pixel of the `state` object
    - use `get_trace_shader_func()` to get the shader from the options
    - implement both a simple loop over pixel and a parallel one, as shown in code
    - for each returns value from the shader, clamp its color if above `params.clamp`
- **Color Shader** in function `trace_color()`:
    - implement a shader that check for intersection and returns the material color
    - use `intersect_scene_bvh()` for intersection
- **Normal Shader** in function `trace_normal()`:
    - implement a shader that check for intersection and returns the normal as a 
      color, with a scale and offset of 0.5 each
    - implement `eval_normal()` for this
- **Texcoord Shader** in function `trace_texcoord()`:
    - implement a shader that check for intersection and returns the texture     
      coordinates as color in the red-green channels; use `fmod()` to force them
      in the [0, 1] range
    - implement `eval_texcoord()` for this
- **Eyelight Shader** in function `trace_eyelight()`:
    - implement a simple shader that compute diffuse lighting from the camera 
      center as in the slides
    - use `eval_normal()` for this
- **Raytrace Shader** in function `trace_raytrace()`:
    - implement a shader that simulates illumination for a variety of materials
      structured following the steps in the lecture notes
    - implement environment lookup in  `eval_environment()`
    - get position, normal and texcoords; correct normals for lines
    - get material values by multiply material constants and textures, evaluated 
      using `eval_texture()` that you have to implement
    - implement polished transmission, polished metals, rough metals, 
      rough plastic, and matte shading in hte order described in the slides
    - you can use any function from Yocto/Math such as `math::fresnel_schlick()`,
      `math::microfacet_distribution()` and `math::microfacet_shadowing()` 

## Extra Credit

Implement refraction using `refract()` for the direction, `reflectivity_to_eta()`
to get the index of refraction from reflectivity (0.04), and remembering to 
invert the index of refraction when leaving a surface.

## Submission

To submit the homework, you need to pack a ZIP file that contains the code 
you write and the images it generates, i.e. the ZIP _with only the 
`yocto_raytrace/` and `out/` directories_.
The file should be called `<numero_di_matricola>.zip` and you should exclude 
all other directories. Send it on Google Classroom.
